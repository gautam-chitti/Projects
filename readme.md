# Academic Projects

This repository contains projects created by me for academic and assignment purposes.  
They reflect my learning and development throughout my coursework.

## Current Projects

- **CapstoneProjectGautamS**  
  My capstone project, completed as part of my academic curriculum.

- **TalentHunt**  
  This project is an intelligent Hiring Assistant chatbot developed for the fictional recruitment agency "TalentHunt". The application serves as a comprehensive initial screening tool that interacts with        candidates to gather essential profile information, conducts a preliminary technical assessment using a Large Language Model (LLM), and securely stores the data for administrator review.
